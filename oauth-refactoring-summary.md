# OAuth Endpoints Refactoring Summary

## Issue #183: Refactor/Align OAuth Endpoints

### Overview
This refactoring ensures full OAuth 2.1 compliance by removing non-standard endpoints and debug endpoints from the OAuth worker implementation.

### Changes Made

#### 1. Removed Non-Standard Endpoints
- **`/oauth/check-client`** - Removed custom client checking endpoint
- **`/oauth/ensure-client`** - Removed custom client creation endpoint
- **`setupClient()` function** - Removed hardcoded client setup function

These endpoints were not part of the OAuth 2.1 specification and were not being used by the frontend application.

#### 2. Removed Debug Endpoints
- **`/debug/pkce-test`** - Removed PKCE testing endpoint
- **`/debug/oauth-state`** - Removed OAuth state debugging endpoint

Debug endpoints should not be present in production deployments.

#### 3. Updated Documentation and Scripts
- **`init-client.sh`** - Deprecated and updated to reference standard registration endpoint
- Added clarifying comments about OAuth 2.1 compliance
- Added note about CORS requirements for MCP dynamic client registration

### Current OAuth 2.1 Compliant Endpoints

The OAuth worker now only implements standard OAuth 2.1 endpoints:

1. **`/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server`** - OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server Metadata (RFC 8414)
2. **`/oauth/authorize`** - Authorization endpoint
3. **`/oauth/token`** - Token endpoint (handled by OAuthProvider)
4. **`/oauth/register`** - Dynamic Client Registration endpoint (RFC 7591)

### OAuth 2.1 Compliance Features

✅ **PKCE Required** - Code challenge method S256 is supported and required for public clients
✅ **No Implicit Flow** - Implicit flow is disabled per OAuth 2.1 best practices
✅ **Authorization Code Grant** - Only secure authorization code flow is supported
✅ **Dynamic Client Registration** - Fully supports RFC 7591 for MCP compliance
✅ **Public Clients Only** - Token endpoint authentication method is "none" for SPAs

### Testing

A compliance test script has been created at `/oauth-worker/test-oauth-compliance.sh` to verify:
- OAuth discovery endpoint works correctly
- Non-standard endpoints return 404
- Dynamic client registration functions properly
- OAuth 2.1 requirements are met

### Frontend Impact

**No changes required** - The frontend application already uses standard OAuth endpoints through:
- OAuth discovery mechanism
- Dynamic client registration
- Standard authorization code flow with PKCE

The frontend was already compliant and did not use the removed non-standard endpoints.

### Deployment Notes

After deploying the updated OAuth worker:
1. Run the compliance test script to verify functionality
2. Clients will automatically use dynamic registration
3. No migration needed as non-standard endpoints were unused

### Security Improvements

- Removed potential attack surface from custom endpoints
- Eliminated debug endpoints that could leak information
- Maintained CORS headers for MCP compatibility while documenting security considerations
