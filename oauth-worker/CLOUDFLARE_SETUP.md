# Cloudflare OAuth Worker Setup Guide

## Setting Up KV Namespace for OAuth Worker

The OAuth worker requires a KV namespace to store authorization codes and tokens. The best approach is to configure this through the Cloudflare dashboard rather than hardcoding it in `wrangler.toml`.

### Step 1: Create the KV Namespace

1. Go to your [Cloudflare Dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com)
2. Navigate to **Workers & Pages** â†’ **KV**
3. Click **"Create namespace"**
4. Name it: `oauth-worker-kv` (or any descriptive name)
5. Note the generated namespace ID

### Step 2: KV Namespace Configuration

The KV namespace ID is now configured in `wrangler.toml` with your namespace ID: `c7741c3a32834498a8318f10968a018d`

This ensures the binding persists across deployments. The binding will be created automatically when the worker is deployed.

**Note**: 
- The binding name MUST be `OAUTH_KV` as required by the OAuth provider package
- Dashboard bindings get overwritten by wrangler deployments, so the ID must be in `wrangler.toml`
- For different environments (staging/production), you can use different namespace IDs

## Important Notes

- The KV namespace is required for the OAuth provider to store authorization codes and tokens
- Each environment (production, staging, etc.) should have its own KV namespace
- The binding name `OAUTH_KV` must match what's expected by the `@cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider` package

## After Setting Up KV Namespace

Once you've created the KV namespace and updated the configuration:

1. Commit and push the updated `wrangler.toml`
2. The Cloudflare Pages deployment should succeed
3. The OAuth worker will be available at your worker URL
4. You'll need to initialize the OAuth client as described in the README
