# OAuth Flow Cycling Fix Summary

## Problem
The OAuth flow was cycling repeatedly making tons of requests to the server for both dashboard card reauthorization and regular playground server connections.

## Root Cause
When the OAuth configuration modal's `onConfigured` callback was triggered after the user saved their credentials:
1. In App.tsx (dashboard flow): It called `handleReauthorizeCard` again
2. In TabContent.tsx (playground flow): It called `handleConnectWrapper` again

Both functions would check for OAuth config/access token, and if not found (due to timing or the fact that the user hasn't gone through authorization yet), would show the config modal again, creating an infinite cycle.

## Solution
Instead of calling the entire OAuth flow again after configuration, we now:
1. Continue directly with the authorization redirect after credentials are saved
2. Build the authorization URL and redirect the user immediately
3. Fixed inconsistency in session storage keys (`oauth_code_verifier` vs `pkce_code_verifier`)

## Changes Made

### 1. App.tsx (Dashboard OAuth Flow)
- Modified the `onConfigured` callback to continue with OAuth authorization directly
- No longer calls `handleReauthorizeCard` recursively
- Builds authorization URL and redirects immediately after config

### 2. TabContent.tsx (Playground OAuth Flow)  
- Modified the `onConfigured` callback to continue with OAuth authorization directly
- No longer calls `handleConnectWrapper` recursively
- Builds authorization URL and redirects immediately after config

### 3. Session Storage Key Consistency
- Fixed inconsistent PKCE code verifier keys
- Changed from `oauth_code_verifier` to `pkce_code_verifier` to match OAuthCallback expectations

## Test Scenarios

### Dashboard Card Reauthorization
1. Click on a card that requires OAuth reauthorization
2. If no OAuth credentials are configured, the config modal should appear
3. After saving credentials, should redirect to authorization URL immediately
4. No cycling should occur

### Playground Connection with OAuth
1. Enable OAuth for a connection
2. Try to connect to a server that requires OAuth
3. If no OAuth credentials are configured, the config modal should appear
4. After saving credentials, should redirect to authorization URL immediately
5. No cycling should occur

### Key Points to Verify
- OAuth config modal appears only once when needed
- After saving credentials, immediate redirect to authorization URL
- No repeated requests or modal cycling
- Proper error handling if OAuth discovery or URL building fails
