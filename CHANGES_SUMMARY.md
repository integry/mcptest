# Follow-up Changes to MCP Server Report

## Summary of Improvements

### 1. Web Client Accessibility (CORS) Section
- **Fixed testedOrigin**: Now uses the actual site URL (`window.location.origin`) instead of hardcoded 'https://mcp.dev'
- **Added comprehensive CORS header reporting**: All CORS response headers are now collected and displayed in metadata
- **Enhanced error messages**: Added hints to help users understand what's expected for proper CORS configuration
- **Better debugging information**: Each CORS check now shows all returned headers to help identify configuration issues

### 2. Transport Layer Modernity Section
- **Always show SSE support status**: SSE support is now always checked and reported, even when it doesn't affect scoring
- **Improved metadata**: Added more detailed information including endpoints, content types, and support status
- **Clear differentiation**: HTTP/NDJSON vs SSE transport types are now clearly shown with their capabilities

### 3. Content Type Verification
- **Changed wording**: Updated from "inferred from successful connection" to "verified from successful connection"
- **Added headers field**: Shows that content-type was verified from the actual MCP client connection

## Technical Changes

### File: `/src/utils/evaluation.ts`

1. **CORS Testing Improvements**:
   - Uses `window.location.origin` as the tested origin
   - Collects all CORS-related headers in a `corsHeaders` object
   - Adds the full header collection to metadata for better debugging
   - Provides helpful hints when CORS is misconfigured

2. **Transport Detection Enhancements**:
   - Always checks for SSE support, regardless of HTTP streaming results
   - Reports SSE status with `supported: true/false` in metadata
   - Shows specific endpoints and content types for each transport type

3. **Better Error Context**:
   - Error messages now include the tested origin
   - Hints guide users on how to fix common issues
   - All available response headers are shown for debugging

These changes make the report more helpful for developers by:
- Using the correct origin for CORS testing
- Showing all relevant headers to help debug issues
- Always reporting on SSE support status
- Providing actionable hints for fixing problems
